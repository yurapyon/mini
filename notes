smaller untyped

take some ideas from colorForth
  "dictionary only records 32 bits of identifier"
    shannon/huffman coding
  code must be in fixed sized blocks
  editor ?
    could do it on the web?
    or love 2d or something

very few builtins
not complicated
easy to read

easy to implement vm

a very short global circular queue could be useful

should be good for
  web (TS or webasm)
  microcontroller
  zig

===

input line buffer
basic most used stack manipulation words
small cells

byte based (?)

memory indexed from zero

hex and decimal numbers

===

builtins can be bytecodes

bytecodes gives you 256 builtins

there can be a bytecode like
#ext sizeof(OS pointer)
for external function calls

atmega program memory is 2bytes (12 bits up to 0x3fff)
