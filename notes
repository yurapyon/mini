take some ideas from colorForth
  "dictionary only records 32 bits of identifier"
    shannon/huffman coding
  code must be in fixed sized blocks
  editor ?
    could do it on the web?
    or love 2d or something

a very short global circular queue could be useful

should be good for
  web (TS or webasm)
  microcontroller
  zig

===

input line buffer
basic most used stack manipulation words
small cells

byte based (?)

memory indexed from zero

hex and decimal numbers

===

builtins can be bytecodes

bytecodes gives you 256 builtins

there can be a bytecode like
#ext sizeof(OS pointer)
for external function calls

atmega program memory is 2bytes (12 bits up to 0x3fff)

===

if builtins are 0-127
and compiled words are 0xC.......

then defining core words as deriving from builtins takes up more space
  than just having it as a builtin
  ie
  <= builtin takes less space even though it could be defined as
  : <= > 0= ;

but also want to balance 'ease of implementing vm' with 'core code reusability'

===

dictionary

definition names can be encoded
  if shannon encoding from colorforth is an example,
  you can fit names 12 chars long in 8 bytes

with untyped, all words have a dictionary entry, even builtins
mini doesnt need that

===

interactivity

bye & quit should be implemented

===

console drawing or display would be nice
could be external functions

===

should be able to interpret itself
  used for
    including files
    executing xts
  words needed
    execute
