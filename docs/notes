immediate:
  '[compile]' and 'literal' are confusing
    things you might want to use [compile] with
      should have non-immediate helper functions
    compiling literals (anything with tags) should be done using
      ' tag c, or ['] tag c, etc and shouldnt be too obfuscated
  'immediate' == 'syntax'
    define compile helpers, but only expose them through syntax
    this keeps the language from beinging too 'macro'y

programs shouldnt expect to have the same base-file/stdlib
  the bytecodes are fixed
  the language is defined at runtime

ext:
  among other things, the reason to use a tag for ext's is that
    the system can determine at compile time if it supports the ext or not
    all behavior that would be available with an ext bytecode
      that pops off the stack is available with an ext tag,
      barring the ability to interpret the ext with the interpreter
    ext words will have to be defined to be called,
      and compiling ext's may often look like:
      [ ' ext c, 0x1234 cell>bytes c, c, ]
    binary system images can be searched for ext's and know what functions are being called

  ext stands for 'external xt' :)
