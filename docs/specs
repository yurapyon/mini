mini specs ===

vm:
  cell size:     2 bytes
  address space: 32k bytes
  endianness:    little
  negatives:     twos-compilment

language:
  untyped
  case-insensitive
  max input line length: 128 chars
  max word name length:  2^16 (limited by input buffer length)
  max numeric base:      36

states:
  0x0 interpret
  0x1 compile

repl behavior:
  quit: exits interpret loop
  bye: system dependent

word definition layout:
  odd length name
  prealign0               16      24              x       x+8
  |?......|previous-------|name...|.......|.......|>127---|code...

  even length name
  prealign0               16      24              x       x+8
  |?......|previous-------|name...|.......|\0-----|>127---|code...

  the name field may be zero terminated to align the entire header to u16s

  terminator is a byte >=128
  terminator bits:
    0: 1
    1: is-immediate
    2: is-hidden
    3: TBD
    4: TBD
    5: TBD
    6: TBD
    7: TBD

program execution:
  behavior of the program counter is well defined and will be the same across systems
    this means ie that execution of 'ext' can only move the PC to PC+2
    this is to keep programs portable

bytecodes:
  list:
    0b0....... 128      core    ( see zig/src/bytecodes.zig )
    0b1aaaaaaa aaaaaaaa absjump ( jump to (a), pushing pc+1 to return stack, address space is 32k )
  semantics:
    most bytecodes:
      compile:   write bytecode for self to memory
      interpret: do something
      execute:   do the same thing as above
    immediate (['], ]):
      compile:   do something
      interpret: do the same thing as above
      execute:   do the same thing as above
    tag (exit, branch, branch0, tailcall, lit, litc, ext):
      compile:   error
      interpret: error
      execute:   do something
    (absjump):
      compile:   n/a
      interpret: n/a
      execute:   push following addr to return stack and jump to address read from memory

non-standard forth words:
  panic      - ( -- )            die

  seldev     - ( id -- )         select device to send commands to
  d!         - ( value addr -- ) store to current device
  d+!        - ( value addr -- ) store-add to current device
  d@         - ( addr -- value ) fetch from current device

  next-char  - ( -- char )       read the next char from the input buffer

  0          - ( -- 0 )
  0xffff     - ( -- 0xffff )
  1          - ( -- 1 )
  2          - ( -- 2 )
  4          - ( -- 4 )
  8          - ( -- 8 )

  cell>bytes - ( cell -- high-byte low-byte )
  bytes>cell - ( high-byte low-byte -- cell )

memory layout:
  0     cell field >program_counter
        cell field >return_stack_top
    32 cells field >return_stack
        cell field >data_stack_top
    32 cells field >data_stack
        cell field >here
        cell field >latest
        cell field >state
        cell field >base
        cell field >active_device
        cell field >input_buffer_at
        cell field >input_buffer_len
         128 field >input_buffer
  constant dictionary_start

devices:
  TBD
  they will be a fixed size and be in memory, similar to uxn
