mini specs ===

vm:
  cell size:     2 bytes
  address space: 64k bytes
  endianness:    little
  negatives:     twos-compilment

language:
  untyped
  case-insensitive
  max input line length: 128 chars
  max word name length:  2^16 (limited by input buffer length)
  max numeric base:      36

states:
  0x0 interpret
  0x1 compile

repl behavior:
  quit: exits interpret loop
  bye: system dependent

word definition layout:
  odd length name
  prealign0               16      24              x       x+8
  |?......|previous-------|name...|.......|.......|>127---|code...

  even length name
  prealign0               16      24              x       x+8
  |?......|previous-------|name...|.......|\0-----|>127---|code...

  the name field may be zero terminated to align the entire header to u16s

  terminator is a byte >=128
  terminator bits:
    0: 1
    1: is-immediate
    2: is-hidden
    3: TBD
    4: TBD
    5: TBD
    6: TBD
    7: TBD

program execution:
  behavior of the program counter is well defined and will be the same across systems
    this means i.e. that execution of 'ext' can only move the PC to PC+2
    this is to keep programs portable

bytecodes:
  semantics:
    most bytecodes:
      compile:   write bytecode for self to memory
      interpret: do something
      execute:   same thing as above
    immediate (['], ]):
      compile:   do something
      interpret: same thing as above
      execute:   same thing as above
    tag (exit, branch, branch0, jump, call, lit, litc, ext):
      compile:   error
      interpret: error
      execute:   do something
    execute:
      compile:   pop xt from stack, start an execute loop
      interpret: same as above
      execute:   pop xt from stack, call it
  tags:
    exit:    pop from return stack and assign to PC
    branch:  relative jump
    branch0: conditional relative jump
    jump:    absolute jump, doesn't return
    cell:    absolute jump, will return
    lit:     push next cell in memory to stack
    litc:    push next byte in memory to stack
    ext:     call system bytecode

non-standard forth words:
  panic      - ( -- )            die

  next-char  - ( -- char )       read the next char from the input buffer

  cell>bytes - ( cell -- high-byte low-byte )
  bytes>cell - ( high-byte low-byte -- cell )

memory layout:
  0     cell field >program_counter
        cell field >return_stack_top
    32 cells field >return_stack
        cell field >data_stack_top
    32 cells field >data_stack
        cell field >here
        cell field >latest
        cell field >state
        cell field >base
        cell field >input_buffer_at
        cell field >input_buffer_len
         128 field >input_buffer
  constant dictionary_start
