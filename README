: mini ;

goals:
  clear, simple and obvious
    don't sacrifice readibility for performance
  evolution of a classic
    "writing a forth" is more important than "designing a modern language"

features:
  overall:
    clean, self-documenting codebase (hopefully)
    well-defined, obvious memory layout
    useful as a self-contained system and for running scripts
    self-hosting with metacompiler
      parser and interpreter written in forth
      boots from a system image
        included system image is pretty small, around 2.5kb
  language features:
    covers most of the ANSI Forth 'Core' word set
    vocabularies
    string escapes, including multiline strings
    easy-to-use FFI, currently builds in:
      OS access
      32-bit floats
  virtual PC:
    based off of the PC-98 computer
    pixel buffer
    character buffer
    mouse/keyboard callbacks

roadmap:
  in progress:
    io
      graphics
      keyboard/mouse
  planned:
    io
      audio
    cross-compiler for avr/pic
