mini specs ===

memory:
  cell size:     2 bytes
  address space: 64k bytes
  endianness:    little
  negatives:     twos-compilment

language:
  case-insensitive

bytecode list:
  0b00...... 64 core       ( see zig/src/bytecodes.zig )
  0b010..... 32 optimizing ( see zig/src/bytecodes.zig )
  0b0110.... 16 currently unimplemented
  0b0111aaaa aaaaaaaa data (push address+2 and length of data (a) (max len is 4096 bytes))
  0b1aaaaaaa aaaaaaaa abs jump to (a)

states:
  0x0 interpret
  0x1 compile
  0x2 mini bytecode
  0x3 system dependent

behavior:
  quit: exits interpret loop
  bye: system dependent

bytecodes:
  semantics:
    most bytecodes:
      compile:   write bytecode for self to memory
      interpret: do something
      execute:   do the same thing as above
    immediate (bracketTick, rBracket):
      compile:   do something
      interpret: do the same thing as above
      execute:   do the same thing as above
    execute only (branch, branch0, tailcall, lit, litc):
      compile:   error
      interpret: error
      execute:   do something
    ##data:
      compile:   write bytecode for self and data from the stack to memory
      interpret: write bytecode for self and data from the stack to memory
      execute:   push address of data and len to stack
    ##absjump:
      compile:   write bytecode for self and absolute jump to memory
      interpret: write bytecode for self and absolute jump to memory
      execute:   push following addr to return stack and jump to address read from memory
