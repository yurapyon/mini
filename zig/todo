handle signed cells

add an error for out of bounds access of MiniVM.memory

handle case insensitivity

figure out how refill functions should work
  its hard to read a file when the input buffer can only be 128 chars
  need to be able to split things line by line

should use memcpy instead of copyforward for most things
