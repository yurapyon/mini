figure out signed cells

figure out how refill functions should work
  its hard to read a file when the input buffer can only be 128 chars
  need to be able to split things line by line

figure out if things like registers/dictionaries
  should have a * to the CellAlignedMemory rather than just take the slice

word headers technically dont need both a terminator and a namelen
could potentially just use one byte for flags and one for name len
for adding mini-word semantics, more flags may be needed
