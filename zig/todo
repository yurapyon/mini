probably
  doubles and unsigned
    may need to extend bytecode count
  set images from within forth
     load block vocab by default

maybe
  rework stacks to be in forth memory
    still circular

probably not
  coroutines
  locals

---

better errors in console when vm crashes
  need to keep track of 'last executed string'
  maybe have a debug mode flag

if some internal state can be invalidated from forth, just truncate/wrap the value in zig
  ie state, context
