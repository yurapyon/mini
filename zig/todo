figure out signed cells

figure out how refill functions should work
  its hard to read a file when the input buffer can only be 128 chars
  need to be able to split things line by line

word headers technically dont need both a terminator and a namelen
could potentially just use one byte for flags and one for name len
for adding mini-word semantics, more flags may be needed

for functions that can return errors
  as long as they won't be called within bytecodes (or as refiller functions)
  they can be more general
