probably
  doubles and unsigned
    may need to extend bytecode count
  rework stacks to be in forth memory
    still circular

maybe

probably not
  coroutines
  locals

---

better errors in console when vm crashes
  need to keep track of 'last executed string'
  maybe have a debug mode flag

if some internal state can be invalidated from forth, just truncate/wrap the value in zig
  ie state, context
