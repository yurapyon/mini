todo

probably
  doubles and unsigned
    may need to extend bytecode count
  set system images from within forth
    load block vocab by default
  random numbers
  search-order
  errors
    better errors in console when vm crashes
    less crashes in general
      if some internal state can be invalidated from forth,
        just truncate/wrap the value in zig ie state, base
        do it on read ie >> const state = state_from_forth & 1;
    maybe have a debug mode cli option
  rework stacks to be in forth memory
    still circular ?
      probably not
    data stack shouldnt have fixed size and should grow limitlessly
  refiller idea probably isnt necessary
    unsure if 'refilling' itself is necessary
      difference between sending strings to forth and having it execute them or
        having forth block and wait for input on its own

maybe

probably not
  coroutines
  locals

notes

repl can use files but system mostly works with images
