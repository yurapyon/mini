todo

probably
  doubles and unsigned
    may need to extend bytecode count
  set images from within forth
    load block vocab by default
  random numbers
  search-order
  errors
    better errors in console when vm crashes
    less crashes in general
      if some internal state can be invalidated from forth,
        just truncate/wrap the value in zig ie state, base
        do it on read ie >> const state = state_from_forth & 1;
    maybe have a debug mode cli option

maybe
  rework stacks to be in forth memory
    still circular

probably not
  coroutines
  locals

---

notes

repl can use files but system mostly works with images
