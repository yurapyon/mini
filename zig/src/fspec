'externals' can be done through differnet code fields,
  up to 2^16 minus 64 reserved for builtins

jump table threading
    x86_64 function pointer size is too big for direct threading to make sense
  all builtins will need definitions
    for a builtin what is the code representation?
      a zig fn pointer? or a cell sized id? byte sized id?
      * implementation defined because the forth word serves
          as the interface between forth and the system
        binaries shouldnt be exected to work the same between systems
          but source code could be

hardware
  fp      forth prgoram counter
  dstack  circular data stack
  rstack  circular return stack
  a       address register
  w       working register

['a] asdf ,   looks up and compiles VM shortcode

necessary shortcodes
  enter   - fp += 2
  exit    - pop rstack to fp
  jump    - jump to fp+2
  call    - push fp+4 to return stack, jump to fp+2
  skip    - if T != 0, jump to fp+6
  skip0   - if T == 0, jump to fp+6
  nop     - do nothing
