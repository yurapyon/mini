files:
  lib/                - "libraries" of external functions
    dynamic.zig       - externals for dynamic memory allocation
    os.zig            - externals for OS access
  system/             - virtual PC
  testing/            - random scripts
  utils/              - zig utils
  bytecodes.zig       - bytecode behaviors and the code-field lookup table
  cli_options.zig     - basic commandline option interpreter
  externals.zig       - struct for defining external functions
  kernel.zig          - defines some types, contains execution loop
  main.zig            - processes commandline options and starts the system
  memory.zig          - memory-related type definitions and error-returning memory access utils
  register.zig        - 'pointer' that stores an offset into forth memory
  self-host.mini.fth  - metacompiler to create a bytecode image for selfhosting
  stack.zig           - data/return stack struct
  startup.mini.fith   - a forth file that defines the 'std library' and most of the language features

undefined behavior:
  mini shouldn't segfault due to invalid memory access
    alignment needs to be checked and turned into a MemoryError
    out of bounds access of the forth memory block needs to be checked too
