zig implementation ==

files:
  runtime.zig      - brings all the vm's components together and defines some types

  stack.zig        - stack structure used for both the data and return stack
  dictionary.zig   - manages the 'here' & 'latest' registers to compile words to forth memory
  input_buffer.zig - manages line-by-line input and input buffer
  register.zig     - memory-mapped 'pointer' into forth memory

  bytecodes.zig    - implements bytecode behaviors and the lookup table

  base.mini.fth    - a forth file that will define the 'std library' and most of the language features

  vm_utils.zig     - utils directly relevant to the VM, ie printing memory or the stack
  memory.zig       - some memory access utils that also return error unions
  utils.zig        - other utils: number parser, comptime utils, lowercase string compare

  main.zig         - just hacks out an end-to-end test for now

undefined behavior:
  compared to untyped, mini should never have a chance to segfault
  alignment needs to be checked and turned into a MemoryError
  out of bounds access of the vm memory block needs to be checked too
