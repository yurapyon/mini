zig implementation ==

setup:
  mac OS, using homebrew:
    $ brew install zig glfw
    $ zig build
    $ ./shell/run.sh

files:
  mini-out/
    precomiled.mini.bin        - main startup image, created as output of self-host.mini.fth
    precomiled-stable.mini.bin - backup startup image, for if there is an error in precompiled.mini.bin, created manually
  shell/
    precompile-stable.sh       - compile the startup image, using precompiled-stable.mini.bin as the runtime
    precompile.sh              - compile the startup image, using precompiled.mini.bin as the runtime
    run.sh                     - run the forth repl, expects 'zig build' has already been called
    system.sh                  - run the virtual pc, expects 'zig build' has already been called
  src/
    examples/                  - more complete scripts
      cal.mini.fth             - prints a calendar
      citrus.mini.fth          - computer status bar
      home.mini.fth            - formats pwd for shell prompts
      life.mini.fth            - conways game of life
      vpc-drawing.mini.fth     - GUI program, for drawing
      vpc-life.mini.fth        - GUI program, conways game of life
      vpc-console.mini.fth     - [WIP] GUI program, simple terminal interface
    sketch/                    - random unfinished/testing scripts
    lib/                       - "libraries" of external functions
      os.zig                   - OS access
      floats.zig               - 32 bit floats
      dynamic.zig              - dynamic memory
    system/                    - virtual PC
    utils/                     - zig utils
    bytecodes.zig              - bytecode behaviors and the code-field lookup table
    cli_options.zig            - basic commandline option interpreter
    externals.zig              - struct for defining external functions
    kernel.zig                 - defines some types, contains execution loop
    main.zig                   - processes commandline options and starts the system
    memory.zig                 - memory-related type definitions and error-returning memory access utils
    register.zig               - 'pointer' that stores an offset into forth memory
    self-host.mini.fth         - metacompiler to create a bytecode image for selfhosting
    stack.zig                  - data/return stack struct
    startup.mini.fith          - a forth file that defines the 'std library' and most of the language features

undefined behavior:
  mini shouldn't segfault due to invalid memory access
    alignment needs to be checked and turned into a MemoryError
    out of bounds access of the forth memory block needs to be checked too
