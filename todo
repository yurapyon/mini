todo

probably
  interpret files from paths on the commandline
  make sure it compiles on linux
  doubles
    may need to extend bytecode count
  search-order
  externals
    random numbers
  errors
    abort
      compare to ansi forth
      catch stack underflow
    better errors in console when vm crashes
    less crashes in general
      if some internal state can be invalidated from forth,
        just truncate/wrap the value in zig ie state, base
        do it on read ie >> const state = state_from_forth & 1;
    maybe have a debug mode cli option

maybe
  floats
  typescript executor for web
    npm package?

probably not
  coroutines
  locals
