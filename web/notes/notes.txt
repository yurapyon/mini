the plan:
  use typescript for:
    system
    interpreter
    compiler

  and hand-coded wasm for:
    executor
    bytecodes
    stack
    register
    dictionary

  maybe at some point it would be cool to have everything in wasm,
    or just the interpreter and compiler
  for now its not worth it and may even be better to write that stuff in typescript first

this is alot the same as the Zig implementation
  but the io setup will be very different
    and when/if we move to using WASM for the executor that will change things alot
